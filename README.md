# OgreBattle-like RTS practice
What I learned from this project:
* Classes in Python
* Pygame Basics

While I didn't make much of a game for this project, I *did* manage to learn the ins and outs of basic pygame tools as well as how Python classes work.

Prior to this project, I hadn't written a single Python class, but the knowledge I needed to make what I did has improved my understanding of tools like Pyplot and scikit learn; this project really helped me wrap my head around the instantiation of classes, what python does to initiate an instantiated class, and inheritance. Classes changed from something that seemed like these magical things with magical methods into something that I understand and would be comfortable with modifying in the future. Unfortunately, the project has a lot of loose ends and the beginnings of features that never got finished, but the bugs are starting to pile up, and it isn't clear how to solve them; I will come back and start anew on this project at some date in order to get repetition on my fundaments.

Next pygame project will be a top-down tactics game like Fire Emblem for the NES. With *this* OgreBattle project, I thought that I was going to make a game, but instead I learned basics about Pygame and Python classes. Who knows what I'll learn with the next project, but the objective will be creating a game; in addition to the task of making a tactics game, I want to learn how to programmatically draw graphics and I want to compose and implement music for the game.
